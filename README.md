# Hourly_CO2_EU

These scripts uses input output modelling to calculate the average emission factor of the different EU countries while accounting for their imports and exports. 
It retrieves the necessary data from ENTSO-E transparency platform.
When it was written, Sweden did not have its data their. Their data was retrieved from other sources.
It is not maintained since 2019 and can be improved.

Original Matlab version created by John Clauss at NTNU. Port to Python and streamlining of data acquisition by Dimitri Pinel and Kasper E. Thorvaldsen at NTNU.
